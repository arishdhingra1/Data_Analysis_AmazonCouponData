# Instructions and Analysis

**Instuctions to run the file:** <br />
  1) Clone the repository. <br />
  2) Run the solution.ipynb file. The path to dataset is already configured but adjust if neccessary as per your local folders. <br /> <br />

**Analysis on Data:** <br />
After running the series of Analysis on the dataset, below are the few analysis that we made: <br /> <br />

  1) The analysis for dataset for '**bar**' coupons: <br />
     a) Overall the acceptance rate of the bar coupons as good which was around 41%. <br />
     b) We also saw that people who occasionally go to the bar (3 or more times) are more likely to accept the coupon than the other people who go to bar fewer times. <br />
     c) Also, people who are age 25 and above are more likely to accept the coupons. <br />
     d) The acceptance rate is higher for the people who have no kids and are not involved in farming, fishing or forstery. <br /> <br />

  2) The analysis for dataset for '**coffee**' coupons: <br />
     a) The people who travel alone are less likely to accept the coupons than the people who are travelling with friends. <br />
     b) The poeple who are travelling to work are more likely to accept the coupons the who are going back home. <br />
     c) The acceptance of coupons on a Sunny day is a bit high than rainy or snowy day. <br />
     d) The coupons are equally accpeted by females and males. <br /> <br />

  3) Non Technical Analysis: Differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons: <br />
     a) We saw the overall count of accepted coupons were more than the coupons that were rejected. Please refer to cell 69 in solution.ipynb file. <br />
     b) The acceptance rate was pretty much similar and between 50% to 60% in all age groups. Please refer to cell 70 in solution.ipynb file. <br />
     c) The highest acceptance rate in coupons was in '**Carry Out**' which was around 75% and the lowest was in '**Bar**' which was 40%. Please refer to cell 72 in solution.ipynb file. <br />
     d) We saw a slight more acceptance rate in coupons for people who travel with '**Friends**' or '**Partners**' than for people who travel '**Alone**' or with '**Kids**'. <br /> <br />

**Next Steps:** <br />
The next step here can be to understand the reason and have additional data on why people accepted or rejected the coupons. This data will help the vendors which are coupon providing businessess here alot. They can remove more barriers in accepting the coupons and can build models on top to test the quality of coupons before rolling it out.
